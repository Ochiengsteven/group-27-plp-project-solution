# 1. Write a python program that simulates a door lock system such that:

# Password is set and stored in a variable,
# Commands to instruct the door are stored in variables.
# When a user enters the wrong password an error message is displayed and prompted to enter the password again.
# When a user enters ‚Äúopen‚Äù a ‚ÄúThe door is now open‚Äù statement is displayed, when the ‚Äúopen‚Äù is entered more that once, a message is displayed saying, ‚Äúthe door is already open‚Äù
# When a user enters ‚Äúclose‚Äù a ‚ÄúThe door is now locked‚Äù statement is displayed, when the ‚Äúopen‚Äù is entered more that once, a message is displayed saying, ‚Äúthe door is already locked‚Äù
# When a user enters ‚Äúquit‚Äù the process is terminated and message is displayed.
# When a wrong message is entered or invalid key pressed a ‚ÄúInvalid input‚Äù message is displayed.
# When the door is locked or open, it prints out the last date/time the door was opened, eg ‚ÄúDoor Last open  at 2022-07-05 08:46:20.535395‚Äù
